      Recently I discovered my Node.js server running in a Docker container not exiting properly. It dropped open connections and left the database connection open. Simple to solve, I thought, listen and handle the exit signal with `process.on('SIGINT')`. Yet the existence of this post, like a bad movie trailer giving away the plot, spoils the surprise it is not that simple.

      Spinning up a fresh new server gives a shiny clean slate to work from. I like to have my own controlled server but a new Linux box is often pretty open to the rest of the world. Securing it is a daunting task the first time. Following is a guide aimed to help with the security essentials. From connecting to the server to setting configuration rules. For this guide I will be using Ubuntu but for most Linux distributions the same applies. Note that almost all server commands need superuser access. To prevent typing `sudo` over and over again, use `sudo -s` in the server beforehand to run a shell with root privileges.
