      Spinning up a fresh new server gives a shiny clean slate to work from. I like to have my own controlled server but a new Linux box is often pretty open to the rest of the world. Securing it is a daunting task the first time. Following is a guide aimed to help with the security essentials. From connecting to the server to setting configuration rules. For this guide I will be using Ubuntu but for most Linux distributions the same applies. Note that almost all server commands need superuser access. To prevent typing `sudo` over and over again, use `sudo -s` in the server beforehand to run a shell with root privileges.
