        <p>My name is Selwyn Versteeg.
            <br><strong class="highlight">I'm passionate about creating solutions that help people around the world in a progressive way.</strong>
            <br>Coding is what I do best but I also love designing and prototyping. Quality is important, spending time on details and optimizing solutions is what I can't resist to do. I'm a perfectionist.</p>
            <p>Currently I'm studying <a href="http://www.cmd-amsterdam.nl/" target="_blank">Communication and Multimedia Design</a> at the HvA. At CMD I learn to work agile in a team and come up with creative solutions.<br>When I'm not busy with my study or coding. I like to jam a bit on my funky drumset, ride my bike or play video games.
